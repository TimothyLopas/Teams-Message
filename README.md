# Overview

A simple python robot that is being used as a sub-module in a larger robot project. 

# Description

This bot uses another open source python library [pymsteams](https://pypi.org/project/pymsteams/), which has been included in the conda.yaml, to streamline the amount of code I needed to write to get a message into a Teams channel via a webhook.
